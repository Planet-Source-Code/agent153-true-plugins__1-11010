I wrote this code in about 10 miniutes. It supports two-way communication between the host app and the plugin. The info between the plugin and the host can be any type except control, vb intrisync controls, forms, mdiforms, or usercontrols. For those data types, you must use the object data type. More extensive code can be written with this, but this is a very basic example. For a more complex example, see Hazardous Materials (not available as of 8-26-2000) at http://hazmat.agent153.net. Let me know what you think of this code sample at agent_153@hotmail.com (The subject line must be "Planet Source Code - Plugin Example" as I filter my email by subject line)
