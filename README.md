## True Plugins


</div>

### Description

This code lets you create a plugin in a similar fashion as Adobe Photoshop or 3d Studio Max. Uses features of ActiveX that nobody seems to realize exist.
 
### More Info
 
When you compile the plugin dll file, you will need to register it on the user's computer with RegSvr32.exe

Weird things happen when you try to creat multiple instances of a plugin. Haven't figured out a fix to it, but it probably won't crash your computer.

VB (5 anyway) does not like doing plugins using the creatobject statement. You won't get crashes if you close improperly, but vb doesn't show the Popups it usually does if you are working with an intrasync vb control.
